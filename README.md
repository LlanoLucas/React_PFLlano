# React_PFLlano

Welcome to my React E-Commerce project! This application is a simple e-commerce platform for buying two courses and one book. It allows users to browse products on the home page, navigate to separate pages for courses and books, add products to a shopping cart, and proceed to the checkout.

For the styles i used only tailwind css for simplicity and speed.

I installed the Sweet Alert 2 dependency, beacuse in the checkout i thought that it would make a better user experience when recieving information.

Thank you for checking out this React E-Commerce project, i hope you like it!
